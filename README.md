# Skib-Lang
A superset of Lua that uses the most up-to-date syntax and coding conventions to both adhere to the newer generation's linguistic needs and not have to program in Lua.

The Skiblang compiler compiles directly to Lua and always embeds Lua and other stuff.

# Examples

SkibLang comes with a variety of features, such as functions.

As an example, this is a simple fizzbuzz program in Skiblang.

#comments and vars

pretty self-explanatory here:

# anonymous functions

use skibidi _() {} to make an anonymoush function :3

# fizzBuzz and functions!

This program will then compile inferior Lua code:

Side Note you can use the keyword "mrworldwide" to make the function public to other modules :D

# variable decleration, loops, breaking!


Now you can't have a modern programming language without loops, so let's put some in our Fizzbuzz program.

Using the "rizz" keyword, we can define a local variable in lua terms to act as an iterator for our gyatt (loop), and once our iterator reaches a certain point, we can hit the breaks with caseoh.

As a note, the "pass" key word is for continue statements.

# embeding!

Now let's do some advanced skib scripting.

This program uses embedding via the "ohio" keyword to allow for the use of lua in skibLang, and with this, we can declare a generic function like map to run the fizzbuzz code below.

# pipes!

However, I'm not quite satisfied yet with the whole look of this, so let's use pipes to make it look good and to spite javascript.

Now, that's not the nicest code you've ever seen.

# modules

Now what about modules? I hear you cry well. You can use the keyword "bussin" to use your favorite modules!

# slotting

Now, with an important note, this will not import your files into Skiblang. Only the slot keyword can also be known as the "kaicenat" keyword.

![image](https://github.com/AlexanderMeade/Skib-Lang/assets/128431625/3d8aa65f-2425-4fd1-b959-2f0063afaaaf)

With the kaicenat keyword, we can slot in the code into our main program!

# namespaceishes

Now the big filepath may be off-putting to you, and with good reason, but we can use the namespace keyword "livvy" to keep it short and sweet.

# uses

since everything in this langauge is built off of lua you can use lua libraries with it such as Love2D which I used here ^^
